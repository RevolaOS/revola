/* Media-list nodes count the tracks and containers below them in two halfwords,
 * +0x2c (containers) and +0x2e (tracks), which caps a library at 65,535 tracks: the
 * import wraps the count, the sort indexes fail to build and the import aborts. Every
 * access moves to a 32-bit track count at +0x2c and the container count to the unused
 * flags halfword at +0x1e (+0x14 is taken: containers keep their lookup key there).
 * Constant words, so the recipe writes them. Adapted from RepriseOS perf/memory
 * payload/track_count.c (93df360). The symbols file keeps Apple's MediaEntry layout;
 * after these words the core reads tracks as a word at MediaEntry_groups and the
 * container count as a halfword at 0x1e. */
