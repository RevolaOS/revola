/* Requests to the host's file worker, which runs on its own task. A Queue
 * entry hands the request over; the worker writes the outputs and links the
 * request after the previous completion through that one's next word, and the
 * host passes the list to the image with a later frame. Nothing marks a
 * request done, so the outputs start as a value the worker never writes and a
 * wait watches them change, yielding in between so the worker runs. The
 * worker writes the outputs in no fixed order and only result on failure, so
 * a wait takes result first and the operation's other outputs on success.
 * An open or a listing that failed still registered its handle, which the
 * caller gives back; a listing's handle arrives after the result, unless the
 * host had no slot for it and overwrote the result with FileStatus_NoSlot.
 *
 * The requests are a ring that is never freed: the worker writes a completed
 * request's next word when the following request completes, which can be
 * after the frame handed the list over, so memory a request lived in must
 * stay a request. The runtime's calls are synchronous, one request in flight
 * at a time, and nothing reads the list the frames carry. */
